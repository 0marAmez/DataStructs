The following project consist of a group files that have the purpose to create a digraph
By reading from an input file and output the adjacent neighbors of every vertex and connected
Components.

FindComponents.c: Reads the input file and outputs the adjacent neighbors and connected components.
Graph.h : Contains the prototypes of the functions that are used in Graph.c and also includes "List.h."
Graph.c: Contains the definition of the functions declare in Graph.h.
** Note: For DFS() a pass by reference approach was implemented to ensure "time" had the right value.
List.h: Contains the prototypes of the doubly linked list functions.
List.c: Contains the definition of the prototypes declared in List.h.
GraphTest.c: Contains some testings of Graph.c.
